                <p>
                    My name is Himadri Narayan Sinha. I have a Bacehlor's of Science in Environmental Science and Policy from St. Edward's University
                    in Austin, TX. However, I have always been interested in full stack development for web applications and software, so I decided to attend
                    the University of California at Davis Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. During this 6 month course, I have learned a lot and I've decided I'm interested
                    in application development for video games and would love to proceed down this career path in the future.
